##### This projects aims to analyse data from Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. The dataset has information of over 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Using IA, we will try to predict churn using the information from EDA and create a model to rank clients by possibility to churn.
